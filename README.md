# Traffic Simulation
This is a C++ traffic simulation project I made for an object-oriented programming class. I still have a few more files to add/edit before
the source code on here is completely up to date. I relied quite a bit on GitHub for this project as there was multiple versions throughout the semester; however, as the final version was due I did not commit all the changes I made, so I need to do that before it is finished.

Note:

For this project to work a data parser is required (I will more fully explain the code when I get every file uploaded and edited), and the instructor for the course provided us one to use. Because I did not write the data parser myself, the source code is obviously not in this repository.
